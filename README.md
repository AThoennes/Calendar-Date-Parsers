# Calendar Date Parsers

The Calendar Date Parsers assignment was the 5th one and was quite challenging. First off, the files TestCalendarDateParser.java and CalendarDateParsers.java rely upon each other. The other files are simple exercises to test various concepts used in the CalendarDateParsers.java file. Second, the whole purpose of this program is to take in a date value in one of the many forms (YYYMMDD, YYYY/MM/DD, etc.) and parse it to separate the year, month, and day into their own strings. There are also methods called isEarlierThan and isLaterThan and CompareTo. The first two are booleans that compare dates. compareTo does the same concep except that it returns a negative value for earlier, a positive value for later, and a 0 if the two date being compared are equal.
